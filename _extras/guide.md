## Workshop structure
This workshop is broken down into four lessons. We recommend breaking the teaching up across half-days, as follows:

| Lesson    | No. half days | 
| ------- | ---------- | 
| [Statistical thinking for public health][stat-think] | 1 | 
| [Simple linear regression for public health][simple-reg] | 2 | 
| [Multiple linear regression for public health][multi-reg] | 1 | 
| [Logistic regression for public health][logis-reg] | 2 | 


## Guidance on teaching style

We recommend this workshop is taught in [Carpentries-style](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). In particular, we recommend:

- Teaching through live-coding. The instructor types code, as laid out in the main body of the materials, at a pace which allows learners to code along.
- Allowing plenty of time for learners to try the exercises between sections of live-coding. 
- If teaching online, using an [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/) to record and answer learner questions. 
- Explaining the mathematical equations laid out in the main body of the materials using an overhead projector, or similar. The instructor can
work with blank sheets of paper, explaining the equations as they write them down. We believe this reduces the cognitive load of learning to
understand the equations, especially for learners without a quantitative background. 

## Technical guidance
Ask learners to go through the [setup][lesson-setup] **prior** to attending the workshop, as package installation can take a while and sometimes learners need to update R. 

## Reference material
We recommend referring to the book ["Regression and Other Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) as the main source behind these teaching materials. 

## FAQs from learners
This section will be updated with questions from future editions of this workshop.
